Yen's K-Shortest Path Algorithm
Yen's algorithm computes single-source K-shortest loopless paths for a graph with non-negative edge cost. The algorithm was published by Jin Y. Yen in 1971 and implores any shortest path algorithm to find the best path, then proceeds to find K âˆ’ 1 deviations of the best path.
