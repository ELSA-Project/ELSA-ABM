 ========================== ELSA-ABM ==========================

This an Agent-Based Model (ABM) simulating different some concepts from air traffic management. It has been developped by the ELSA project, "Empirically grounded agent based models for the future ATM scenario", funded via the Work Package E of SESAR. It aims at studying some of the new concepts foreseen by SESAR.

----------------------- Getting started ------------------------

The setup is straightforward. Just clone the source code by creating a directory where you see fit, entering the directory and running git clone <link> if git is already installed, or (to complete).

Then you should make sure that all the dependencies required are installed. The following python modules should be installed:

 -- scipy
 -- shapely
 -- networkx
 -- basemap
 -- MySQLdb
 -- matplotlib
 -- descartes

On bsd-like system like Ubuntu, you can use easy_install. First install easy_install using:

sudo apt-get install easy_install 

Then installing all modules:

easy_install scipy, shapely, networkx, basemap, MySQLdb, maplotlib, descartes

Once the source code has been downloaded and the dependencies satisfied, you can run the setup.py in the main folder in command line:

./setup.py

It will prompt you for the path of the directory you want for the results generated by the code. It then compiles the C code, makes the python wrapper for the tactical level and generates the html documentation describing the Python code.

After that you can run some tests with:

tests/run_all_tests.py

if you want and run a small example like this:

TBD

The code is organized as follows:
 -- the abm_strategic folder contains an ABM simulating the strategic phase, including a network builder, airlines and flights objects, and a network manager allocating the airspace to the airlines. 
  -- the abm_tactical folder contains a tactical model including a "mega-controller" with different rules of conflict resolution as well as a "shock generator".
  -- the interface folder contains very basic functions which allows to easily control the tactical model from Python.
  -- the libs folder gathers several hand-made libraries.
  -- the scripts folder contains some handy scripts which can be used as examples to produce results with the model
  -- the tests folder contains several scripts for unitary and manual tests. 
  -- the doc folder gathers the documentation, in the form of html files describing the python code and pdf files for small tutorials.

If you are in a hurry, you can start right away your own script, importing the most important functions using:

from abm_strategic import *

and/or:

from abm_tactical import *

More details are available in the Getting_started.pdf file.
